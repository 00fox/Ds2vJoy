<h1>Zip Utils - clean, elegant, simple, C++/win32</h1>

<p>Adding zip/unzip easily, no LIBS or DLLs, with an elegant and simple API.<br>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>This source code shows how to add zip/unzip functionality to your programs. Lots of people have
written their own wrappers around zip, and indeed there are several articles on codeproject that
are based on earlier versions of my own code. How is this version different?</P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Clean packaging.</STRONG> There's one pair of files <CODE>zip.cpp</CODE>,<CODE>zip.h</CODE>
    to add to your project if you want zip. Another pair <CODE>unzip.cpp</CODE>,<CODE>unzip.h</CODE>
    if you want unzip (or both if you want both!). There are <EM>NO</EM> additional libraries or
    DLLs to worry about.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Clean API.</STRONG> Most other APIs around zip/unzip are terrible. This one is best.
    The API is short, clean, and in a familiar win32 style. Most other APIs wrap things up in classes,
    which is ugly overkill for such a small problem and always turns out too inflexible. Mine don't.
    See the code snippets below.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Flexibility.</STRONG> With this code you can unzip from a zip that's in a diskfile,
    memory-buffer, pipe. You can unzip into a diskfile, memory-buffer or pipe. The same for creating
    zipfiles. This means that at last you don't need to write out your files to a temporary directory
    before using them! One noteworthy feature is that you can <EM>unzip directly from an embedded
    resource</EM> into a memory buffer or onto a diskfile, which is great for installers. Another
    is the ability to create your zip in dynamically growable memory backed by the system pagefile.
    Despite all this power, the API remains clean and simple. The power didn't come from just writing
    wrappers around other people's code. It came from restructuring the internals of zlib and info-zip
    source code. My code is unique in what it does here.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Encryption.</STRONG> This version supports password-based zip encryption. Passwords are
    absent from many other zip libraries, including gzip.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Unicode.</STRONG> This version supports unicode filenames.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Windows CE.</STRONG> This version works as it is under Windows CE. No need to alter makefiles
    or #defines, or worry about compatability of any LIB/DLL.</LI>
<LI><STRONG>Bugfixes.</STRONG> This code is based on gzip 1.1.4, which fixes a security vulnerability
    in 1.1.3. (An earlier version of my code used 1.1.3, and has crept into other codeproject articles...)</LI>
</UL>

<P>At its core my code uses zlib and info-zip. See at end for acknowledgements.</P>


<H2>Using the code</H2>

<P>To add zip functionality to your code, add the file <CODE>zip.cpp</CODE> to your project,
and <CODE><span class='cpp-preprocessor'>#include "zip.h"</span></CODE> to your source code.</P>

<P>Similarly for unzipping, add the file <CODE>unzip.cpp</CODE> to the project and
<CODE><span class='cpp-preprocessor'>#include "unzip.h"</span></CODE> to your source code.
Zip and unzip can co-exist happily a single application. Or you can omit one or the other if
you're trying to save space.</P>

<P>The following code snippets show how to use zip/unzip. They are taken from one of the demo applications
including in the download. It also has project files for Visual Studio .NET and Borland C++Builder6 and
Embedded Visual C++ 3. The code snippets here use ASCII. But the functions all take arguments of type
TCHAR* rather than char*, so you can use it fine under Unicode.</P>

<H3>Example 1 - create a zipfile from existing files</H3>

<PRE>
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// We place the file "simple.bmp" inside, but inside</span>
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// the zipfile it will actually be called "znsimple.bmp".</span>
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// Similarly the textfile.</span>

  HZIP hz = CreateZip(<span class='cpp-string'>"simple1.zip"</span>,<span class='cpp-literal'>0</span>);
  ZipAdd(hz,<span class='cpp-string'>"znsimple.bmp"</span>,  <span class='cpp-string'>"simple.bmp"</span>);
  ZipAdd(hz,<span class='cpp-string'>"znsimple.txt"</span>,  <span class='cpp-string'>"simple.txt"</span>);
  CloseZip(hz);
</PRE>


<H3>Example 2 - unzip a zipfile using the names it has inside it</H3>

<PRE>
  HZIP hz = OpenZip(<span class='cpp-string'>"\\simple1.zip"</span>,<span class='cpp-literal'>0</span>);
  ZIPENTRY ze; GetZipItem(hz,-<span class='cpp-literal'>1</span>,&amp;ze); <span class='cpp-keyword'>int</span> numitems=ze.index;
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// -1 gives overall information about the zipfile</span>
  <span class='cpp-keyword'>for</span> (<span class='cpp-keyword'>int</span> zi=<span class='cpp-literal'>0</span>; zi&lt;numitems; zi++)
  { ZIPENTRY ze; GetZipItem(hz,zi,&amp;ze); <span class='cpp-comment'>// fetch individual details</span>
    UnzipItem(hz, zi, ze.name);         <span class='cpp-comment'>// e.g. the item's name.</span>
  }
  CloseZip(hz);
</PRE>


<H3>Example 3- unzip from resource directly into memory</H3>

<P>This technique is useful for small games, where you want to keep all resources bundled up inside
the executable, but restricting the size.</P>

<P>Suppose we used a .rc with<BR>
<CODE><span class='cpp-literal'>1</span> RCDATA <span class='cpp-string'>"file.zip"</span></CODE><BR>
to embed the zipfile as a resource.

<PRE>
  HRSRC hrsrc = FindResource(hInstance,MAKEINTRESOURCE(<span class='cpp-literal'>1</span>),RT_RCDATA);
  HANDLE hglob = LoadResource(hInstance,hrsrc);
  <span class='cpp-keyword'>void</span> *zipbuf = LockResource(hglob);
  <span class='cpp-keyword'>unsigned</span> <span class='cpp-keyword'>int</span> ziplen = SizeofResource(hInstance,hrsrc);
  hz = OpenZip(zipbuf, ziplen, <span class='cpp-literal'>0</span>);
  ZIPENTRY ze; <span class='cpp-keyword'>int</span> i; FindZipItem(hz,<span class='cpp-string'>"sample.jpg"</span>,<span class='cpp-keyword'>true</span>,&amp;i,&amp;ze);
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// that lets us search for an item by filename.</span>
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// Now we unzip it to a membuffer.</span>
  <span class='cpp-keyword'>char</span> *ibuf = <span class='cpp-keyword'>new</span> <span class='cpp-keyword'>char</span>[ze.unc_size];
  UnzipItem(hz,i, ibuf, ze.unc_size);
  ...
  <span class='cpp-keyword'>delete</span>[] ibuf;
  CloseZip(hz);
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// note: no need to free resources obtained through Find/Load/LockResource</span>
</PRE>


<H3>Example 4 - unzip chunk by chunk to a membuffer</H3>

<P>Normally when you call <CODE>UnzipItem(...)</CODE> it gives the return-code ZR_OK.
But if you gave it too small a buffer so that it couldn't fit it all in, then it return ZR_MORE.</P>

<PRE>
  <span class='cpp-keyword'>char</span> buf[<span class='cpp-literal'>1024</span>]; ZRESULT zr=ZR_MORE; <span class='cpp-keyword'>unsigned</span> <span class='cpp-keyword'>long</span> totsize=<span class='cpp-literal'>0</span>;
  <span class='cpp-keyword'>while</span> (zr==ZR_MORE)
  { zr = UnzipItem(hz,i, buf,<span class='cpp-literal'>1024</span>);
    <span class='cpp-keyword'>unsigned</span> <span class='cpp-keyword'>long</span> bufsize=<span class='cpp-literal'>1024</span>; <span class='cpp-keyword'>if</span> (zr==ZR_OK) bufsize=ze.unc_size-totsize;
    <span class='cpp-comment'>... maybe write the buffer to a disk file here</span>
    totsize+=bufsize;
  }
</PRE>

<p>One final option: if you compile with "ZIP_STD" defined for the preprocessor, then
zip and unzip will compile using solely stdlib -- with no windows dependencies. They
can compile under linux with g++. Note that some of the prototypes in zip.h and unzip.h
will change accordingly: filetimes will be time_t structures rather than FILETIME, and
various functions will use FILE* rather than HANDLE, and it doesn't support unicode
or memory-mapping. The example program "std" does this.</p>


<h2>Common Questions</h2>

<p><strong>STRICT?</strong> I think you should always compile with
STRICT (in project-settings/preprocessor/defines), and full warnings
turned on. Without STRICT, the HZIP handle becomes interchangeable
with all other handles.</p>


<p><strong>How to show a progress dialog?</strong> One of the included examples,
"progress", shows how to do this.</p>

<p><strong>How to add/remove files from an existing zipfile?</strong> The zip_utils
currently only allow you to OpenZip() for unzipping, or CreateZip() for adding, but
don't allow you to mix the two. To modify an existing zip (eg. adding or removing
a file) you need to create a new zip and copy all the existing items from the
old into the new. One of the included examples, "modify", shows how to do this.
It defines two functions:</p>
<pre>
  ZRESULT RemoveFileFromZip(<span class='cpp-keyword'>const</span> TCHAR *zip, <span class='cpp-keyword'>const</span> TCHAR *name);
  ZRESULT AddFileToZip(<span class='cpp-keyword'>const</span> TCHAR *zip, <span class='cpp-keyword'>const</span> TCHAR *name, <span class='cpp-keyword'>const</span> TCHAR *fn);
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// eg. AddFileToZip("c:\\archive.zip","znsimple.txt","c:\\docs\\file.txt");</span>
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// If the zipfile already contained that thing (case-insensitive), it is removed.</span>
  <span class='cpp-comment'>// These two functions are defined in "modify.cpp"</span>
</pre>

<p><strong>"fatal error C1010: unexpected end of file</strong> while looking for precompiled header directive".
To fix this, select zip.cpp and unzip.cpp and change
<em>Project &gt; Settings &gt; C++ &gt; PrecompiledHeaders</em> to <em>NotUsingPrecompiledHeaders</em>.</p>


<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Efrat says: "I think the design is very bad", and so objects when I say that
my API is clean and others are not. (Actually, he says my documentation is the most conceited he's seen and my design is the worst that he's seen!)
I've reproduced his comments here, with my responses, so you can make a
more informed decision whether to use my library.</p>


<p><em>[Efrat]</em> Better instead to use the
<a href="http://home.comcast.net/~jturkanis/iostreams/libs/iostreams/doc/home.html">boost IOStream library</a>.<br>
<em>[Response]</em> I love the boost library. If people can figure out how to
add it to their projects and zip/unzip with it, they should definitely use boost rather
than my code. (I'm still trying to figure it out, though, and couldn't get it to
compile under CE).</p>

<p><em>[Efrat]</em> A compressed archive has internal state; it's a classic object; the author's
criticisms of OOP are unjustified. "OOP doesn't mean placing your code in a cpp file."<br>
<em>[Response]</em> I'm trying not to be OOP.
(1) you'll never inherit from an archive, nor invoke virtual methods from it:
we only use encapsulation, not any of the other pillars of OOP. By using an opaque handle HZIP
rather than a class, I indicate this clearly to the programmer. Also
(2) C++ classes don't work cleanly across DLLs. Handles like HZIPs do.<br>
<em>[Efrat]</em> For intance, progress-notifications should be done by virtual functions in a
derived class, not by callbacks.<br>
<em>[Response]</em> To get progress, you invoke UnzipItem in a while loop, and each iteration
unzips a little bit more of the file. This is clean, re-entrant, and has a simple API. I think
this is an easier API than inheriting from a class. I think inheritance from
library classes is bad, in general.</p>

<p><em>[Efrat]</em> Compression should go in a DLL.<br>
<em>[Response]</em> I disagree. DLLs are always pain, for developers as well as users.
Unzip only adds 40k in any case.</p>

<p><em>[Efrat]</em> The API doesn't use the type system to differentiate between
an HZIP for zipping and an HZIP for unzipping.<br>
<em>[Response]</em> This was intentional. The difference between zipping and unzipping
is an current implementation drawback. I think an API should be clean, "aspirational", and
you shouldn't encode current implementation limitations into the type system.</p>

<p><em>[Efrat]</em> The API uses error-codes, rather than exceptions, but anyone who has
graudated Programming 101 knows exceptions are better.<br>
<em>[Response]</em> I think exceptions are not welcomed anywhere nearly as widely as Efrat
suggests. Also, they don't work cleanly across DLL boundaries, and they don't work on
PocketPC.</p>

<p><em>[Efrat]</em> The API is unflexible; it should be coded for change, not just coded
for all the options that were conceived while designing (handles,files, memory). Most
users will think of sources and targets which this design can't support.</br>
<em>[Response]</em> The original zip uses FILE*s, which are effectively the same as windows
pipes. I also provided memory-buffers which adds an enormous amount of flexibility
that's easy to use and requires no additional programming. For any users who <em>need</em>
sources and targets which can't be reached via a memory buffer, they shouldn't use
these zip_utils.</p>

<em>[Efrat]</em> The is unnecessarily Windows-specific. The original zlib works great
and is portable; zip_utils offers no advantages.
Compression is memory-manipulation and IO and so should not be platform-specific.<br>
<em>[Response]</em> In the olden days before STL, "cross-platform" code inevitably meant
(1) peppered with so many #ifdefs that you couldn't read it, (2) didn't work straight
away under windows. I started from and old code-base, and so Efrat's proposed bottom-up
rewrite was not possible. The advantage this code offers over zlib is that it's
just a single file to add to your project, it works first time under windows, you can
add it easily as a cpp module to your project (not just dll/lib), and the API is simpler.</p>


<p>In general, Efrat wants code to be a clean extensible framework. I don't; I want
small compact code that works fine as it is. Furthermore, I think that "framework-isation"
is the biggest source of bugs and code overruns in the industry.</p>




<H2>Acknowledgements</H2>

<p>This version of article was updated on 28th July 2005. Many thanks to the readers at CodeProject who
found bugs and contributed fixes to an earlier version. There was one terrible bug where, after a large
file had been unzipped, then the next one might not work. Alvin77 spotted this bug.</p>

<P>My work is a repackaged form of extracts from the zlib code available at
<a target=_top href="http://www.gzip.org/zlib">www.gzip.org/zlib</A> by Jean-Loup
Gailly and Mark Adler and others. Also from the info-zip source code at
<a target=_top href="http://www.info-zip.org">www.info-zip.org</A>. Plus a
bunch of my own changes. The original source code can be found at those two
mentioned websites. Also the original copyright notices can be found there,
and also inside the files zip.cpp and unzip.cpp of my code.</P>
