General:
- Converted the use of dll in static.
- Added Emergency with escape: if something goes wrong, stay pushed on ESC for more than two seconds, and program will stop to interprete and doing actions as long you push it.
- Progress bar when loading and changing language to stay tuned of what happen.
- Multiple icons in system tray to know actual states.
- Only last finger emplacement count for touchpad.
- Fix screen limits while move mouse with multiple monitors.

Mapping:
- Added buttons for battery, mic state, USB.
- Added buttons for DirectInput, more constant buttons.
- Added buttons for vJoy Axis to Trigger ans Inverse.
- Added buttons for vJoy virtual working evironement: 8 axis and 16 buttons.
- Added buttons for Stance and actual position - while DS4/DS5.
- Added buttons for Sixaxis (Velocity + Gyrocompass) - while DS4/DS5.
- Changed all buttons caluculus to long, and values to short (except threshold in byte), values only at the end. More consistent with multiple sources and destinations.
- Mouse moves and serveral time action based, now follow the average time turn, so it won't be pad or blutooth dependant anymore and feel more stable and always same speed.
- While in a mapping, you can valid changements and reload it the same time by clicking at the right of the button OK (to make several quick tests for ex.).
- Added after effects actions (can be used to calibrate too)

Settings:
- language system added in settings, push your traduction if you want.
- Added DirectInput choice and configuration in settings for up to simultaneous two devices, you can choose which buttons will correspond to what in the program, so for example, you can use special features as simultaneous L1R1 presses.
- Skip vigem DS4 as an available serial.
- vJoy device acquisition selection can be set to none.
- Threshold usage modified.
- Black theme change all the program and not only the Notepad.

Diverse:
- Text corrected for TO_MEM_MODE special action
- Mouse movement stops if source is disconnected to prevent uncontrollable behavior (but you can still use it if you haven't specified a joystick as the source)
- Bug with battery values and mic status with ds5 solved.
- Visual bug with second source in mappings corrected.
- Code optomization

Ds2vjoy Magnifier x64 only
Added Magnifier
And mouse actions do deal with:

MAGNIFY: Set magnification on according to values specified in the grid
if x=y=0, magnification is set on center of the screen
if x=1 y=0, magnification is set on actual cursor position
if x=0 y=1, magnification is set on actual point (last memorized)
if x=y=1, magnification is set on the given point (w,h)
if nw == 0, factor is actual factor, else it will be nw.nh (nh is the fractional part of zoom level)
MAGNIFY_PLUS, MAGNIFY_MINUS: control the factor of magnification
MAGNIFY_RESET: temporary return to full screen, values are not modified then you can go back to actual zoom just after
MAGNIFY_UP, MAGNIFY_DOWN, MAGNIFY_LEFT, MAGNIFY_RIGHT: move up, down, left or right while magnification factor > 1

Ds2vjoy Notepad and various improvements x64 only
Added Notepad:

Click on maximize to hide/show notepad
Notepad is saved every 5 seconds of inactivity if there was any modification, while Notepad is shown, or as soon as you close it
You can install full Notepad font used by default, you can install it on your system. You'll find it under Ds2vJoy/Fonts directory
You can specify your own font, for that manually edit Ds2vJoy.ini file, and modify NotepadFont=NotepadFont,16,0

For example, NotepadFont=Consolas,14,6 change the font to Consolas family, height of 14, width of 6 (0 is default)
Remember you can use MINIMIZE/RESTORE special actions, for example, quickly hide/show the notepad over the game, and you can right click on window's title bar to make the window semi transparent.

Ds2vjoy new mode actions x64
Changed some mode action rules and added 1+1+1(8) new ones:
At the left of destinations, you'll find special mouse, sound, modes and time actions
â€¦
MEMORIZE_MODE: Memorize actual mode, Mappings share the same mode, but each one save his individual 'last mode'
TO_MEM_MODE: Go back to memorized mode
TO_MODE: Switch to mode 1-8
TO_LAST_MODE: Go back to last mode
BASE_TO_MODE: Change base mode to 1-8 (base mode is a virtual concept about a real mode, therefore, can be used to emulate different cases to which all other modes go back after)
TO_BASE_MODE: Go back to base mode

20211025-1
Ds2vjoy various patch x64
+ Led wave cycle acceleration in settings
+ Disable double for source:
Under each source and destination, you'll find disabling
this button will be disabled for next mappings if this mapping is running (except with Force)
double (only source), if Short (or Double), even when release time, before time to activate spent (or second press)
double (only destination), if time stamp is in use, disabling will be effective until whole mapping is finished instead this destination only
+ Changed source value used to calculate destination value rules:
OrXor1	OrXor2	Sustain ?	Source1		Source2		Source3		Source1
0	0	'No Sustain' ?	val					>	released1
1/2	0	> : 0xFF	val	>	val			>	released1
0	1/2	(see Controls/	val					>	released1
1/2	1/2	Interrupt)	val	>	val	>	val	>	released1
sustain is released and time stamps is in use (and no 'Interrupt' else mapping is stopped when released)

Ds2vjoy new transitivity mode x64
Added 'Conduct' to transitivity modes, and updated the Table of transitivity in the help as below:
Table of Transitivity:
Transitivity	Pause	Type	Result
One time	Conduct	If the source is already pushed when entering the new mode,
the mapping is triggered
Transitivity		Complete	You can release and trigger again in new mode
if it was already active before changing mode
Transitivity	One time	Limited	Action continue while changing mode,
but you can't trigger again if release
Come back		Retroactive	Instead of continuation, button is released,
but triggered again if still pushed when initial mode is back
Come back	One time	One time back	The same as Retroactive, but while pushed,
you can change mode and get it triggered again only one time
After, you have to release and trigger it again in its own mode
in any case, you cannot launch the mapping of a mode when another mode is active, if it was not activated before this change of mode
except conduct, especially useful to, for example: FULL>Led2 (placed under a tab switched to mode 2) to indicate mode 2 is well activating
Type of release : MINOR (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)


20211003-1

S+A	It will activate window of the specified process before (each key if 'Natual typing' is in use)
PATCH (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)

20211001-1
Ds2vjoy keymap upgrade x64
Changed the keymap structure to concorde to these added in the help:
You can now enter up to 64 characters per keymap
You can enter directly keys in the 'Enter Keycode' part, or use 'Send Keycode' choices (for advanced use)
'Natural typing' is a simple way, without seeking for perfection, nor performance goal, to write as a human
'Send to', permit you to specify the process, and will ungrey (disabled) Find button
'By post message / activating window' let you choice the method if 'Send to' is active
Post message is an internal way of programs, if they support it, to send and/or receive messages
Activating put the window foreground if necessary, and focus the keystroke on it (doesn't work if minimized)
If 'Send to' is active, you can maximize, restore etc window before
but, they are also served alone, together with minimize, hide etc, for example to manage your windows on the screen, and no longer a game, even if you don't enter any text to send
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-showwindow
KEYEVENTF_EXTENDEDKEY: If specified, the scan code was preceded by a prefix byte that has the value 0xE0 (224).
KEYEVENTF_SCANCODE: If specified, wScan identifies the key and wVk is ignored.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/ns-winuser-keybdinput
Solved clear problem, which didn't work if you didn't enter new keys before saving
Type of release : MINOR+PATCH (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)

20210930-1
Ds2vjoy notice and vJoy second view x64
Added the possibility to add notes, notice, rule, combo description etc to vJoy list according to this rules added in the help:

vJoy
Sort, order, add, delete, copy or edit (double click or menu) your mappings easily
Or Move them to another tab (0-8, 0 is the first, always seen as 'Always')

Two different orders exist for each column
single click corresponds to single column natural ordering, except there isn't inverted order, you can proceed on several columns in succession
clicking twice consecutively on the same, launch a programmed sort operation (see table below)
for security reasons, you have to maintain the right button down and then left click on the column header (avoid unwanted sorts, while order is important in your mapping)
Instead, with a simple left click, you change the view (one for mapping different of clone's) and get a 'Notice' column instead of 'vJoy+Tags'
Then with a right click on an item, you can manage to add and view a note, comment, notice, reminder, game rule, combo description, etc. different for each (max 260 characters)
Views (which one) are saved, and restored when you open the program again
(vJoy only, RapidFire and Keymap use natural + reverse order without the need of right mouse button down)
Type of release : MINOR (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)

20210929-1
Ds2vjoy sorting, time, transitivity and Axis movements x64
Opened Issues, please report bugs, problems, you're also welcome to suggest ideas or requests

Added a method of upgrading profile while important changes are made
this is the case in this release, all profiles of last version will be upgraded to the new one, but CAREFUL! keep a copy of an older version than 20210828-3, as it won't, to copy your mapping from older to new one (just mapping, the rest will stay unchanged)
Sorting method added under vJoy, RapidFire and Keymap Tabs while clicking on headers of the list (for vJoy, be careful you'll have to manually reorder if order is important in your mapping, but still can be useful), added to the Help:
Two different orders exist for each column (vJoy only)
single click corresponds to single column natural ordering, except there isn't inverted order, you can proceed on several columns in succession
clicking twice consecutively on the same, launch a programmed sort operation (see table below)
for security reasons, you have to maintain the right button down and then left click on the column header (avoid unwanted sorts, while order is important in your mapping)
RapidFire and Keymap use natural + reverse order without the need of right mouse button down
Sorting order (Programmed method):

column	1	2	3	4	5	7	8
1	Enable	ds1	dsor	dsnot	Led	vj	Tags
2	Enable	dsor	dsnot	Led	vj	ds1	Tags
3	Enable	dsnot	Led	vj	ds1	dsor	Tags
4	Enable	Led	vj	ds1	dsor	dsnot	Tags
5	Enable	Tags	ds1	dsor	dsnot	Led	vj
in either case, vj are the first valid ones found among the eight available, no matter where you put them.
Transitivity added since we already added modes and how to memorize, change them and coming back, and it was obvious that we could add some rules and possibilities to them, added to the Help (vJoy editing):
While talking about OnRelease middle destination checkboxes, and just after:

Upper one, NoRelease, is to decide to not do release action while transitivity mode active (see below) and mode changed
double, one turn of this release action will still be performed then stopped
Upper one again, NlRelease (normal release), is to decide not perform NoRelease condition if back to initial mode
double, not perform NoRelease condition while in the new mode
(2*8 checkboxes have been added)

In the section which talk about buttons under Led buttons:

Pause: â€¦
â€¦
double: One time, used in Transitivity (see table of transitivity below)
Transitivity: Principal way of transitivity which brings different behaviors and transition possibilities while mode changed
double, Come back, another way of transitivity which brings its owns (see table of transitivity below)
(1 checkbox has been added, 'Transitivity'/'Come back' and 'Pause' can be double checked to 'One time' now)

Table of Transitivity:

Transitivity	Pause	Type	Result
Transitivity		Complete	You can release and trigger again in new mode
if it was already active before changing mode
Transitivity	One time	Limited	Action continue while changing mode, but you can't trigger again if release
Come back		Retroactive	Instead of continuation, button is released,
but triggered again if still pushed when initial mode is back
Come back	One time	One time back	The same as Retroactive,
but while pushed, you can change mode and get it triggered again only one time
After, you have to release and trigger it again in its own mode
in any case, you cannot launch the mapping of a mode when another mode is active, if it was not activated before this change of mode
While editing a vJoy mapping you now have the choice of special mouse, sound, modes and time actions for all destinations, up from first row only
Added a third mouse move action, and save n move action, with nh and nw of the grid, as destination point
If you enter a stop time to move mouse actions, the movement is done in the time of (stop - start)ms, adjusted to average turn (+ bluetooth delay if used)
Added four Grid or Raid mouse actions
At the left of destinations, you'll find special mouse, sound, modes and time actions
â€¦
GRID_LEFT/GRID_UP/GRID_RIGHT/GRID_DOWN: If you use Grid or Raid mouse mode (see mouse group checkboxes), can move one tick in any of four directions
Added 7 special actions in mouse, sound, modes ans time actions
â€¦
FORGOT_RELEASED: Loose the released state if source has been released before, and force it to check it again
IF RELEASED GOTO: Go to the specified point of the timeline, if source has been released (use stop value)
IF PUSHED GOTO: Go to the specified point of the timeline, if source is still pushed (use stop value)
RETURN_TO: return to the specified point of the timeline, resetting the actions if they need to be (use stop value)
INTERRUPT: same as 'Interrupt' condition, but time dependent
NO_SUSTAIN: same as 'No sustain' condition, but time dependent
PAUSE: same as 'Pause' condition, but time dependent
(see an example in the help)
Added Axis movement according to this rules added in the help
â€¦
Double, you'll find Axis movements (see a picture in the help)

if no start/stop time is entered, the value used to calculate the position is the usual source calculation value
otherwise, the movement undergoes its complete evolution over time, going from start to stop
if OnRelease is used, the movement will start after release
double, the movement start at the start time, undergoes its complete evolution over time, going from start to stop, and stay at its maximum if finished before release + stop time
Upper one, Overcontrol:
Like for normal axis, the value of axis movement takes place over last axis values of the same type (for example X, XTR, XINV, XY_C_UR: XY center to UpRight)

but you can use Overcontrol checkbox to fuse values
double, Protect: further axis action which should overpass this one won't be permit (may be used on other vJoy buttons)
if there are merged vJoy axes of type X, Y, Z, RZ in the mapping, the threshold is removed on, respectively, the LX, LY, RX, RY axes of ds
All possible axis movements: (for X,Y,Z,RZ. other axis do only complete revolution)

Complete turn, clockwise or counterclockwise, starting by the north (motorization, loops, perpetual motion)
Stay at the middle (combos and technology)
Stay at one of the eight typical position of the circonference (W, NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW)
Quarter of turn, clockwise and counterclockwise (Q1=NE, Q2=SE, Q3=SW, Q4=NW)
Eighth of turn, clockwise and counterclockwise (E1=NNE, E2=ENE, E3=ESE, E4=SSE, E5=SSW, E6=WSW, E7=WNW, E8=NNW)
Center to one of the eight position of the circonference
One of the eight position of the circonference to center
Each of the eight possible diagonals
Four sides, eight moves, of the two triangles (upside and downside base, identical to the square)
Four sides, eight moves, of the square
Four sides, eight moves, of the lozange (diamond)
Then you can now have merged axis values, and not have to use the same type all the time, on the one hand for mapping, and also for ViGEm
The values of the axis are now proportional to the threshold, so the grip remains soft rather than starting abruptly, even with high threshold values
Added source trigger Axis, each axis is split into two full trigger, four by stick, you can use them individually on a button or an trigger, or together on the same, so for example left or right isn't important at all
Added source sniper axis, which works the same except the threshold is minimal, then you can have near no threshold some times and keep normal axis with the threshold you defined for usual situations.
It's near no threshold and not no threshold because I've used them to stabilize sniper mouse mode, which require liberty of movement but not erratic while near center
Added mouse coordinates in vJoy editing at the lower right corner
Two digits in the lower right corner are the mouse coordinates, to make it easier to enter special mouse actions
click on the left number to start capture, the color changes for 3s, and after 3s it come back to its normal state with the mouse point you were at captured
click on the right number, while you already selected an element of the grid, insert the coordinates into this column (x,y or w,h or nw,nh)
Patched guardian whitelist that was broken
Some code optimization, and the ViGEm problems during profile change definitely solved
Ordered Ds2vJoy.rc, to help if you want to traduce in your language

Type of release : PATCH (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)

20210828-1
Ds2vjoy multiselection editing x64
Added the possibility to multiselection editing under vJoy, RapidFire and Keympap tabs, modified help this way:

Edit, delete, copy and move actions can process multiple mappings(/rapid fires/keymaps) the same time
You can for example copy Square/Triangle/Circle/Cross and after edit all the copies the same time to add L1 as source, then you'll have L1+Square/L1+Triangle/L1+Circle/L1+Cross. After that, you'll just need to change the destination for each
When edit, editor is a blank one, and only touched values will be repercuted to the selection you've made before. You don't need to enter a valid (DS/)vJoy button
Changed the visual of RapidFire and Keymap tabs, and added destination process and tags under Keympap, modified help this way:

Tags:

Tag	Description
Empty	Nothing is checked
P	'Send to' is checked
A	'By Postmessage / activation window' is checked
Tags	In practice
Empty	The keys will be sent to your actual focus
P	It will use Postmessage to send keys to specified process
PA	It will activate window of the specified process before
A	Act like if nothing were checked, the keys will be sent to your actual focus
Listview's tooltips of vJoy, RapidFire and Keympap tabs, no longer disapear under window when in topmost state (foreground by extended mode or button pushed in the up right corner)

New method to run at startup as the old one warmed for troyan if clicked too much often

Ds2vjoy drawers, clone, and modes for mappings x64
Added drawers and, the ability of moving between them, and affecting a different mode for each
Added a dual view where you can clone a tab, for example to compare, move or just fill ViGEm with the values of vJoy in front of you
Then, have added modes functionality (known as shifted), you can switch and go back, or more complex, according to these rules added to the help:

vJoy
Each tab corresponds to a drawer, in which you can organize the different mappings

Each of these tabs are by default, like the first one, set to 'Always', but just show their numbers.
'Always' means that all mappings, if they are checked, will always work, just, the tabs are processed in the order of appearance
But you can assign a mode for each of these tabs, which allows you to say that the mappings they contain will only be active in this mode
The tabs left in the 'Always' position will remain active even if you are in another mode than the starting one: the 1 (see vJoy editing, special mouse actions, sound and modes, to know how)
The first tab is neutral and cannot be assigned to another mode, the others (1-8) all can. There is no order to follow, and two tabs can share the same mode. On the other hand, the order of processing is also the order of the tabs
There is a dual view mode, where you can clone a tab

For example to compare, move
Or simply fill ViGEm with the values of vJoy in front of you
The second window will stay opened in extended view (see Efficiency) for this purpose. You still can close it manually
Otherwise, automatically hidden, outside extended mode, if you change tabs
You get it back if you change again for vJoy Tab, until you manually close it
Order, add, delete, copy or edit (double click or menu) your mappings easily
Or Move them to another tab (0-8, 0 is the first, always seen as 'Always')

Delete, copy and move actions can process multiple mappings the same time
when copy only one, it is added just after the source of the copy, if multiple ones are processed, they are all added at the end of the Tab
vJoy editing
At the left of first 4 destinations, you'll find special mouse actions, sound and modes
...
MEMORIZE_MODE: Memorize actual mode, Mappings share the same mode, but each one save his individual 'last mode'
TO_MODE: Switch to mode 1-8
TO_LAST_MODE: Go back to last mode, memorized when MEMORIZE_MODE used
Efficiency (see picture in help)
On bottom right, you can see a Reminder to remember dispatch of attributed buttons
You can use it as you wish, it is saved as soon as you change a state, and you get it back next session
Corner indicator automatically indicates all vJoy buttons (1-32) used in all mappings
